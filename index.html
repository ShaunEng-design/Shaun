                <p>DesignX was established to address the need for affordable website solutions for small businesses.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Many small businesses, such as home bakeries or home maintenance companies, may not have the budget for high-end websites. 
                    These businesses often require simple yet effective websites that convey essential information without the need for costly features.</p>

            <h2>Static page Websites</h2>
            <br>
            <p>We specialize in designing and building streamlined static websites that prioritize simplicity and efficiency. Our goal is to create clear, concise pages 
            that allow visitors to easily find the information they need without sifting through excessive text or images. </p>
            <br>
            <p>With straightforward navigation and well-organized content, our websites stand out by offering a user-friendly experience in contrast to the increasingly complex and flashy websites of today.

            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <br>
            <div class="main2box1text">
                <p>With over 22 years of experience in the IT field, I have accumulated a wealth of knowledge, primarily in the infrastructure space. After noticing 
                    the lack of online presence among many small businesses, I made the decision to transition into web development.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In today’s digital age, the first thing most people do when searching for a business is to "<span class="bigg"><span class="b">G</span><span class="r">o</span><span class="y">o</span><span class="b">g</span><span class="g">l</span><span class="r">e</span></span> it". Therefore, 
                    having any form of online presence is essential for the success and visibility of any company.

            <br>
            <div class="main2box1text">
                <p>We are dedicated to helping businesses establish an online presence. Even a simple website can make a big difference—by being accessible, it allows potential customers to easily see what you offer.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Our websites are straightforward and to the point. We focus on presenting the essential information clearly, so visitors can quickly understand who you are, what services or products you provide, and view any relevant examples, such as past maintenance projects, cakes, charms, or whatever your business specializes in. No frills, no fuss—just effective, clean design.
