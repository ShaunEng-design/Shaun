                <p>DesignX was established to address the need for affordable website solutions for small businesses.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Many small businesses, such as home bakeries or home maintenance companies, may not have the budget for high-end websites. 
                    These businesses often require simple yet effective websites that convey essential information without the need for costly features.</p>

No frills, no fuss—just effective, clean design.
